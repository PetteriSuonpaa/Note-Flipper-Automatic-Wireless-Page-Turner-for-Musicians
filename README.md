# 🎵 Note Flipper™ – Automatic Wireless Page Turner  

📄 [Project Presentation (PDF)](Noteflipper_presentation.pdf)

We will eradicate all awkward pauses for musicians.  
**Note Flipper™** is an automatic, wireless, fast, and portable page-turning device.  
It works with traditional paper notebooks, offering an alternative to digital interfaces while preserving a more authentic musical experience.

## 📚 About the Project  
This project was developed as part of the **ELEC-C9801 – Design Thinking and Electronic Prototyping (5 ECTS)** course at Aalto University.  

Our team consisted of two members:  
- **Petteri** – Responsible for **electronics design and coding** (Arduino, servo control, Bluetooth integration).  
- **Teammate** – Responsible for **mechanical design and prototyping**.

## 🚀 How It Works  
- The **pedal unit** sends a signal via Bluetooth when pressed.  
- The **flipper unit** receives the signal and triggers the servo motors.  
- A servo arm flips the paper to the next page instantly.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Compact PCB design to reduce wiring  
- Rechargeable battery system  
- Adjustable speed and torque for different paper types  
- More ergonomic pedal design
